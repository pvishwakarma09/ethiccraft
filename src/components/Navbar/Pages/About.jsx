        for the purpose of empowering the youth of India on the matter of values
        and social well-being. With the purpose of youth empowerment through
        knowledge blended with wisdom while simultaneously providing them with a

        youths cultivate know about values and subsequently help embellish their
        personality by cultivating values to experience the real joyful nature
        of the self. The club also aims to help youth provide a platform where
